A company is using AWS to design a web application that will process insurance quotes. Users will request quotes from the application. Quotes must be separated by quote type, must be responded to within 24 hours, and must not get lost. The solution must maximize operational efficiency and must minimize maintenance.

Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Create multiple Amazon Kinesis data streams based on the quote type. Configure the web application to send messages to the proper data stream. Configure each backend group of application servers to use the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to pool messages from its own data stream.
B. Create an AWS Lambda function and an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for each quote type. Subscribe the Lambda function to its associated SNS topic. Configure the application to publish requests for quotes to the appropriate SNS topic.
C. Create a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues to the SNS topic. Configure SNS message filtering to publish messages to the proper SQS queue based on the quote type. Configure each backend application server to use its own SQS queue.
D. Create multiple Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams based on the quote type to deliver data streams to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster. Configure the application to send messages to the proper delivery stream. Configure each backend group of application servers to search for the messages from OpenSearch Service and process them accordingly.

A company uses a legacy application to produce data in CSV format. The legacy application stores the output data in Amazon S3. The company is deploying a new commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) application that can perform complex SQL queries to analyze data that is stored in Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3 only. However, the COTS application cannot process the .csv files that the legacy application produces.

The company cannot update the legacy application to produce data in another format. The company needs to implement a solution so that the COTS application can use the data that the legacy application produces.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job that runs on a schedule. Configure the ETL job to process the .csv files and store the processed data in Amazon Redshift.
B. Develop a Python script that runs on Amazon EC2 instances to convert the .csv files to .sql files. Invoke the Python script on a cron schedule to store the output files in Amazon S3.
C. Create an AWS Lambda function and an Amazon DynamoDB table. Use an S3 event to invoke the Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to perform an extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to process the .csv files and store the processed data in the DynamoDB table.
D. Use Amazon EventBridge to launch an Amazon EMR cluster on a weekly schedule. Configure the EMR cluster to perform an extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to process the .csv files and store the processed data in an Amazon Redshift table.
